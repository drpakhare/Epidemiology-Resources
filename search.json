    "text": "Need to calculate sample size\n\nPower\nValidity of conclusions\nOptimal usage of resources\nEthics\n\n\nOne of the key element of any research is to decide number of participants required to be enrolled in the study. We have to take decision on sample size at the time of developing protocol of the study. But why we need to decide sample size? We design study to draw valid conclusions. We want that results of our study should stand and be precise to add to the scientific evidence. This means our experiment or study should have enough power to detect what is being investigated. Science is about trial and error, we conduct a trial and explore for errors in the trial. Our aim is to keep errors to the minimum. Enrolling enough sample size to keep errors low is required for successful study. This decision has implications for the budget as well as time required for the study. If we enroll too many subjects than required for enough power, then it is wastage of resources as well as unethical in the sense it may expose more people if something is invasive or harmful. If we enroll too few subjects , then it may not have enough power and our conclusions will not stand. It is also unethical because you have exposed people to certain risk under your research and that research is now inconclusive. Thus, sample size calculation has to be done at the protocol stage."
