## When longitudinal follow up is not possible

-   Long latency period of chronic diseases

    -   Smoking \~ CVD, Lung cancer

    -   Diet & exercise \~ Osteoporosis

-   Disease incidence \~ relatively few

    -   but all to be followed

-   Very rare diseases- cohort way inefficient

## Example-1: Atypical fractures

-   mid 2000s, \~ unusual form of femoral fracture in women

-   Bisphosphonates suspected because

    -   newly introduced at that time

    -   act by reducing bone remodeling.

-   Case series \~ bisphosphonates and atypical fractures,

    -   other drugs

    -   other diseases

-   Whether bisphosphonates were independently associated with atypical fractures?

## Example-1: Atypical fractures {.smaller}

Bisphonates use and atypical fractures of femoral shaft[@schilcher2011]

-   National Swedish Patient Register,
-   all 59 women age 55 years or older with atypical femoral fractures in 2008
-   263 controls, women in the same registry who had had ordinary femoral fractures
-   other variables - age, use of bone-modifying drugs (corticosteroids or estrogens), and diseases such as osteoporosis and previous fractures
-   concluded women taking bisphosphonates were 33 times more likely to develop atypical fractures

## Control

-   Control in other situations

-   Experimental studies

    -   those who are not exposed to the intervention

-   Diagnostic laboratories

    -   Specimen which have known amount of what is being tested

-   Case-control study-

    -   those who do not have disease or outcome

    -   controls- take in account or subtract the effects of other variables

## Selection of cases

-   Diagnosis - rigorously confirmed

-   All cases or representative sample from defined population

-   Hospital cases

    -   Severity or atypical nature

    -   Catchment area

## Selection of controls

-   Validity- comparability of cases and controls

-   Cases and controls should be members of same base population

-   Random sample of non-cases

-   Methods of selection

    -   Population approach

    -   Cohort approach

    -   Hospital & Community approach

## Population approach

-   Random sample of defined population

-   Dynamic population

-   Cases and controls selected at similar calender time

## Cohort approach

-   Cases and control sampled from same cohort

-   All cases and random sample from base cohort

    -   Case-cohort study

-   All cases and random sample at the time of incident case

    -   Nested Case-Control study

## Why do case-control within cohort?

-   When variables not available in cohort base are to be studied

-   not collected at base

    -   not feasible to collect for all participants at baseline
    -   cost
        -   additional biomarkers

        -   genetic analysis
    -   time
        -   missing information from records

        -   additional questionnaire

## Hospital and Community Controls {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Hospital

-   Select comparable controls

-   Cases from hospital ward- controls from a different disease from same hospital

-   Hospitalized patients usually have different distribution compared to the rest of the population
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Community

-   From catchment area of hospital

-   Neighborhood controls
:::
:::

## Measurement of exposure

-   More than one control group

    -   Community

    -   Hospital

        -   Another disease

        -   Non-diseased - Caregivers

-   Odds ratios across groups

    -   Similar- less likelihood of bias
    -   Heterogeneous- Bias likely

## Multiple controls per case

-   Different from multiple control groups

-   More than 1 control for a cases

-   Useful in case of very rare disease as cases will be few

-   To improve statistical power

-   Maximum up to 3 to 4 controls per case

## Measurement of exposure {.smaller}

-   Complete & accurate records before development of disease

-   Can be done for prescriptions, medical records of investigations, procedures or done on stored samples

-   Behavioral exposures

-   Diet, exercise, substance use etc Disease status may influence recall

-   Exposure measurement methods and tools to be same for both cases and controls

# Analysis of Case-Control Study

## Comparisons {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Cohort Study

-   We know totals of exposed and non-exposed since we only fix them

-   We estimate incidence in exposed & non-exposed and compare relative incidence ![](images/comparison_cohort.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### **Case-Control Study**

-   We know totals of Cases and Non-cases since we only fix them

-   We estimate exposure odds among cases & non-cases & compute ratio of two odds ![](images/comparison_case_control.png)
:::
:::

## Odds ratio {.smaller}

$Odds\ of\ exposure\ in\ Cases = \frac{Number\ of\ exposed\ among\ Cases}{Number\ of\ non-exposed\ among\ Cases}$

$Odds\ of\ exposure\ in\ Cases = \frac{a}{c}$\

$Odds\ of\ exposure\ in\ Non-Cases = \frac{Number\ of\ exposed\ among\ Non-Cases}{Number\ of\ non-exposed\ among\ Non-Cases}$

\
$Odds\ of\ exposure\ in\ Non-Cases = \frac{b}{c}$

$Odds\ ratio = \frac{Odds\ of\ exposure\ among\ Cases}{Odds\ of\ exposure\ among\ Non-Cases}$

$Odds\ ratio = \frac{ad}{bc}$

![](images/case_control_alphabets.png){fig-align="right" width="545"}

## Interpretation of Odds Ratio

-   Association of exposure and outcome

-   OR \> 1 (more than one)

    -   Cases are more likely to be exposed than non-cases. Exposure may be a risk factor

-   OR \< 1 (less than one)

    -   Cases are less likely to be exposed than non-cases. Exposure may be a protective factor

-   OR =1 (nearly one)

    -   Exposure variable is similarly distributed among Cases and Non-Cases

```{r}
library(epiR)
epi.2by2(dat = c(46, 26, 13, 237), method = "case.control")
```

# Issues in Case-Control Study

## Selection of cases

-   Prevalent cases

    -   Associated factors for duration, survivors

-   Hospitals

    -   Severity

    -   Socio-economic position

-   Differential selection probability

## Selection of controls

-   Hospital

    -   Distinct distribution of variables than population

-   Household / Best friend

    -   Over-matching

-   Population

    -   Non-response

## Measurement of exposure

-   Poor or limited recall

    -   Past exposures not remembered well hence not reported
    -   Non-differential misclassification

-   Differential recall

    -   Diseased or cases easily identify with exposure than non-cases

    -   Differential misclassification
